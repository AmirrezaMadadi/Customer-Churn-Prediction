## Customer-Churn-Prediction
## Goal : 
According to the latest surveys we conducted last month, our bank's customers are decreasing.
In the first step, we intend to understand the reason(s) for this sudden churn.
In the next step, we will try to design a model that will detect whether a customer with certain features may intend to leave our bank or not.

## Approach : 
Therefore, in the first step, we explain the reasons with the tools and science we have.
And in the second step, we build the model.
The construction of our model is completed when we reach a minimum accuracy of 85%.

## The structure of dataset :
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 10,000 rows (samples) and 14 columns (13 features). The dataset's primary objective is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank based on their demographics and financial information. The dataset contains several independent variables, which are potential factors that may influence a customer's decision to leave the bank. You will get to know the features in the table below :
